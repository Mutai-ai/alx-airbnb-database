## 1NF - First Normal Form
- All tables have atomic columns (no multiple values in one column).
- Each record is uniquely identifiable via a primary key (UUID).
  
## 2NF - Second Normal Form

- No tables use composite primary keys.
- Every non-key attribute fully depends on the entire primary key.
- Thus it is in 2NF
  
## 3NF - Third Normal Form

-In the Property table, `location` is a textual field likely to be repeated.
- This creates transitive dependency: `property â†’ location (text)` which may lead to redundancy.
- So we separate it by introducing another table 'Location'
